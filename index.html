# Talk Summary

* Origin of XBlocks

* topic

* topic

---

# What is an edX course?

* An edX course is a tree composed of XBlocks.

.float-left.scale50[![Course tree diagram](assets/edx_course.png "edX Course")]

---

# XBlocks Origin

--

* Course authors wanted to add their own interactive course modules.

--

* Too difficult to add code to edx-platform in order to add these custom modules.

--

* Needed a way to enable:

--

 * course authors to develop modules independently of edx-platform

--

 * edx.org (and other OpenEdx installations) to plugin these externally developed modules

--

* The XBlock architecture was developed to meet these needs.

---

# <b>Exactly</b> what is an XBlock?

--
<br>
<br>
<center>A Python module in a separate repository</center>

---

# What's in an XBlock Python module?

--

* A Python class derived from the core XBlock class, containing:

--

  * <b>Fields</b>

--

  * <b>Views</b>

--

  * <b>Handlers</b>

---

# Fields

--

* Store block state data.

--

* Several basic field types, such as:

--

 * Integer
 * String
 * DateTime
 * List
 * Set
 * etc....

---

# Field Examples:

```python
    ssh_pwd = String(
        default='~',
        scope=Scope.user_state,
        help="When using cd command, previous path is stored here."
    )

    visible_to_staff_only = Boolean(
        default=False,
        scope=Scope.settings,
        help="If true, seen only by course staff, regardless of start date."
    )
```
---

# Views

--
<br>
<br>
* student_view() - for the LMS

* author_view() & studio_view() - for Studio

---

# View Example - student_view()

```python
def student_view(self, context=None):
    """
    The primary view of the AudioXBlock, shown to students
    when viewing courses.
    """
    html = self.load_resource("static/html/audio.html")
    frag = Fragment(html.format(src = self.src))
    frag.add_css(self.load_resource("static/css/audio.css"))
    return frag
```
---

# View Example - studio_view()

```python
def studio_view(self, context):
    """
    The view for editing the AudioXBlock parameters inside Studio.
    """
    html = self.load_resource("static/html/audio_edit.html")
    frag = Fragment(html.format(src = self.src))
    js = self.load_resource("static/js/src/audio_edit.js")
    frag.add_javascript(js)
    frag.initialize_js('AudioEditBlock')
    return frag
```
---

# Handlers

--

* Python methods to handle user input

--

* Invoked while user is interacting with the XBlock

--

* Client-side Javascript calls the methods

--

* Some examples:

--

 * Change the subtitles on this video to Spanish

--

 * Submit preliminary answer.

---

# Handler Example

--

```python
@XBlock.json_handler
def getPort(self, data, suffix=''):
    selected_host = data["selectedHost"]
    x = 0
    for i in self.ssh_hostnames:
        if (i==selected_host):
            return {"port": self.ssh_portList[x]}
        x += 1
    return {"port": ""}
```

---

# XBlock Environments

--

* As previously stated, XBlocks operate within LMS and Studio.

--

* Other environments, such as XBlock workbench, are possible.

--

* An XBlock might need interaction with its running environment, such as:

--

 * Information about the current user

--
 * Upload this file

---

# How does an XBlock interact with its environment?

--

* The XBlock runtime

.float-left.scale50[![XBlock Runtime diagram](assets/runtime.png "XBlock Runtime")]

---

# XBlock Runtime

--

* Provides:

--

 * User registration

--

 * Progress tracking

--

 * Grading

---

# XBlock Runtime


* Data storage

--

 * Course content stored in MongoDB

--

 * Student response data in MySQL

--

<b>BUT:</b>

--

Your XBlock code doesn't care!

--

* Specify the correct Field scopes.

 * Storage is abstracted away by XBlock runtime.

---

# XBlock vs. LTI

* LTI - Learning Tools Interoperability

* A way to integrate external learning experiences into edX courses.

* External grades are securely transferred back to the edX course.

* Which should I use? / What's the difference?

---

# XBlock vs. LTI

* XBlock:

 * runs along with/inside of LMS.
 * installed into LMS code and is tightly coupled.

* LTI:

 * integrates a separate app with LMS.
 * loosely coupled with LMS.

---

# XBlock vs. LTI

* XBlock:
 * written in Python/JS/HTML only.
 * currently only an Open Edx "standard".

* LTI
 * module can be in any language.
 * widely adopted standard and can be used in other contexts.

---

# What's Right For My Course Situation?

You: <b>SO</b> - I need an XBlock that does:

* <insert interesting educational experience here...>.

What should <b>I</b> do?

* JFTR, LTI exists and is usable.
* First, check the list of existing XBlocks here:
* If no existing XBlock:
 * learn the architecture and possibilities of XBlocks
 * determine if it makes sense for your situation.

---

# XBlock Development

You: XBlock is definitely the way to go! How do I get started?

* Go through the tutorial.

* Examine existing XBlocks.

* Ask questions on the edx-code mailing list and/or Slack channel.
