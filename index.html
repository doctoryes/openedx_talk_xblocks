# Talk Summary

* What is an XBlock?

* XBlock Composition

* Should you create an XBlock?

---

# What is an edX course?

* An edX course is a tree composed of XBlocks.

.float-left.scale50[![Course tree diagram](assets/edx_course.png "edX Course")]

---

# XBlocks Origin

--

* Course authors wanted to add their own interactive course modules.

--

* Too difficult to add code to edx-platform in order to add these custom modules.

--

* Needed a way to enable:

--

 * course authors to develop modules independently of edx-platform

--

 * edx.org (and other OpenEdx installations) to plugin these externally developed modules

--

* The XBlock architecture was developed to meet these needs.

---

# <b>Exactly</b> what is an XBlock?

--
<br>
<br>
<center>An stand-alone, installable Python module</center>
--
<br>
<center>that does <b>not</b> have to be open-sourced.</center>

---

# What's in an XBlock Python module?

--

* A Python class derived from the core XBlock class, containing:

--

  * <b>Fields</b>

--

  * <b>Views</b>

--

  * <b>Handlers</b>

---

# XBlock Fields

--

* Store block state data.

--

* Several basic field types, such as:

--

 * Integer
 * String
 * DateTime
 * List
 * Set
 * etc....

---

# XBlock Field Examples:

```python
    ssh_pwd = String(
        default='~',
        scope=Scope.user_state,
        help="When using cd command, previous path is stored here."
    )

    visible_to_staff_only = Boolean(
        default=False,
        scope=Scope.settings,
        help="If true, seen only by course staff, regardless of start date."
    )
```
---

# XBlock Views

--

<br>
* For the LMS:

 * `student_view()`

* For Studio:

 * `author_view()` & `studio_view()`

---

# XBlock View Example - student_view()

```python
def student_view(self, context=None):
    """
    The primary view of the AudioXBlock, shown to students
    when viewing courses.
    """
    html = self.load_resource("static/html/audio.html")
    frag = Fragment(html.format(src = self.src))
    frag.add_css(self.load_resource("static/css/audio.css"))
    return frag
```
---

# XBlock View Example - studio_view()

```python
def studio_view(self, context):
    """
    The view for editing the AudioXBlock parameters inside Studio.
    """
    html = self.load_resource("static/html/audio_edit.html")
    frag = Fragment(html.format(src = self.src))
    js = self.load_resource("static/js/src/audio_edit.js")
    frag.add_javascript(js)
    frag.initialize_js('AudioEditBlock')
    return frag
```
---

# XBlock Handlers

--

* Python methods to handle user input

--

* Invoked while user is interacting with the XBlock

--

* Called by client-side Javascript embedded in the rendered XBlock

--

* Some examples:

--

 * Change the subtitles on this video to Spanish

--

 * Submit a preliminary answer.

---

# XBlock Handler Example

--

```python
@XBlock.json_handler
def getPort(self, data, suffix=''):
    selected_host = data["selectedHost"]
    x = 0
    for i in self.ssh_hostnames:
        if (i==selected_host):
            return {"port": self.ssh_portList[x]}
        x += 1
    return {"port": ""}
```

---

# XBlock Environments

--

* As previously stated, XBlocks operate within LMS and Studio.

--

* Other environments, such as XBlock workbench, are possible.

--

* An XBlock may need interaction with its running environment, such as:

--

 * Information about the current user

--

 * Has this user completed problem X?

---

# XBlock Environment Interaction

--

* How does an XBlock interact with its environment?

--

* The XBlock runtime

.float-left.scale50[![XBlock Runtime diagram](assets/runtime.png "XBlock Runtime")]

---

# XBlock Runtime

--

* Provides:

--

 * User registration

--

 * Progress tracking

--

 * Grading

---

# XBlock Runtime


* Data storage

--

 * Course content stored in MongoDB

--

 * Student response data in MySQL

--

<b>BUT:</b>

--

Your XBlock code doesn't care!

--

* Specify the correct Field scopes.

 * Storage is abstracted away by XBlock runtime.

---

# XBlock vs. LTI

* LTI - Learning Tools Interoperability

* A way to integrate external learning experiences into edX courses.

* External grades are securely transferred back to the edX course.

* Which should I use? / What's the difference?

---

# XBlock vs. LTI

* XBlock:
 * runs along with/inside of LMS.
 * installed into LMS code and is tightly coupled.

* LTI:
 * integrates a separate app with LMS.
 * loosely coupled with LMS.

---

# XBlock vs. LTI

* XBlock:
 * written in Python/JS/HTML only.
 * currently only an Open Edx "standard" - not formally adopted.

* LTI
 * module can be in any language.
 * widely adopted standard and can be used in other contexts.

---

# What's Right For My Course Situation?

--

<b>SO</b> - you need an XBlock that does:

--

<i>insert interesting educational experience here...</i>

--

What should <b>you</b> do?
--

* Note: LTI exists and is usable.
* First, check the [list of existing XBlocks](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/COMM/XBlocks+Directory).
* If no existing XBlock:
 * learn the architecture and possibilities of XBlocks
 * determine if it makes sense for your situation.
 * See also: [Five ways to extend edX](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Five-ways-to-extend-edX)

---

# XBlock Development

--

<b>SO</b> - you've determined an XBlock is definitely the way to go!

--

How do you get started?

--
* Go through the tutorial.

* Examine existing XBlocks.

* Ask questions on the edx-code mailing list and/or Slack channel.

 * [edx-code Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edx-code)

 * [#general on OpenEdx Slack](https://openedx.slack.com)

---

# XBlock Resources

* Learning about XBlocks

 * [XBlock API doc](http://xblock.readthedocs.org/ "XBlock API Doc")

 * [XBlock Tutorial](http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/xblock-tutorial)

* What XBlocks currently exist?

 * [XBlocks Directory](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/COMM/XBlocks+Directory)

 * [xblocks.org](http://xblocks.org/)
